## Hello there!

We at KJSCE CodeCell are constantly working to spread knowledge and help people get started into programming - going through dozens of tutorials, pages and pages of documentation - all so that you don't have to. We have started a new initiative - presenting to you the official blog site for KJSCE CodeCell - a place where you can read about our workshops, find tutorials to get started with a range of technologies, and most important of all - a place where the experience of dozens of people over the years has been compressed and penned down for others to read.
